## Why I chose this theme(colors) in my project

I chose this bright purple and pink gradient colors because I’m experimenting with colors and design as I learn web development.
It helps me practice making elements like the hero, buttons, and cards stand out and look good on all devices.
This theme reflects my learning journey bold, fun, and always improving. It is also feels modern, energetic, and fun hoping to learn
fast as I see light colors which attract a person to want to know more about it. I didn't remove header color(black) reason is for clarity 
and to focus on learning layout and design first. Plus I am still trying to match colors to be consistancy throughout my page.
